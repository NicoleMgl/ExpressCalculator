# ExpressCalculator
Can be run by using Node! 
<br><br>
Use terminal to call `node calculator.js`. Travel to `localhost:3000` to play around. The BMI calculator can be found at `localhost:3000/bmicalculator`. This project was made to experiment with launching my own server and keeping my JavaScript server-side. ðŸ˜ƒ
